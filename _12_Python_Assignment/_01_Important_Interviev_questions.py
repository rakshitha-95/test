'''Important Questions'''
"""How python interpreter works
1.The interpreter reads a python code or instruction. Then it verifies that the instruction is well formatted
2.If there is no error, i.e. if the python instruction or code is well formatted then the interpreter translates 
it into its equivalent form in intermediate language 
3.Byte code is sent to the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).Here again the byte code is executed on PVM.If an error occurs during
 this execution then the execution ...
 
 **Python features
 
 1) Easy to Learn and Use

    Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as
    the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.

2) Expressive Language
    Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world program you simply type
    print("Hello World"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines.

3) Interpreted Language
    Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of
    being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.

4) Cross-platform Language
  Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that 
  Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing
  a program only once.

5) Free and Open Source
  Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website www.python.org
. It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working towards make new python modules and functions. 
  Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source means, "Anyone can download its source code without paying 
  any penny."

6) Object-Oriented Language
   Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance,
   polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and 
   develop applications in less code.

7) Extensible
   It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our 
   Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that byte code.

8) Large Standard Library
    It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also 
    for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch,
    etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.

9) GUI Programming Support
   Graphical User Interface is used for the developing Desktop application. PyQT5, Tkinter, Kivy are the libraries which 
   are used for developing the web application.

10) Integrated
   It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python runs code line by line like C,C++ Java.
   It makes easy to debug the code.

11. Embeddable
   The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python source code in another 
   programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code.

12. Dynamic Memory Allocation
In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically 
allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to
write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.

 **Interpretor
 Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being 
 interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.
 
 **Flavours of python
 
1.CPython : CPython is the Python compiler implemented in C programming language. In this, Python code is internally converted 
into the byte code using standard C functions. ...

2.Jython : Earlier known as JPython. Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the
 Java platform. ...
 
3.PyPy : This is the implementation using Python language. PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy is a just-in-time 
compiler while CPython is an interpreter.

4.IronPython : IronPython is an open-source implementation of the Python programming language which is tightly integrated
 with the .NET Framework.
 
5.RubyPython : RubyPython is a bridge between the Ruby and Python interpreters. It embeds a Python interpreter in
 the Ruby application’s process using FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
 
 **Dynamically typed programming language
 Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the 
 type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime. Here are a couple of examples that demonstrate those ideas: In the 
 first example, the branch 1 + "two" never runs, so it’s never type checked.
 
 **procedure oriented v/s object oriented
 
 Following are the important differences between Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)


**PYTHON IDEs

   There are many free and commercial IDEs available for Python. Here, we will learn how to use some open-source editors
    to execute Python scripts or statements.

1.Jupyter Notebook

 The Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based graphical interface to the IPython shell. It allows the user to include formatted text, 
 static and dynamic visualizations, mathematical equations, JavaScript widgets, etc. along with the Python code. The Jupyter
 Notebook document can be exported to PDF, Python script, or HTML.
 By default, the IPython kernel drives the Jupyter Notebook application. However, it supports other languages like Julia 
 and R. (Jupyter stands for JUlia, PYThon, and R).

2.Visual Studio Code

   Visual Studio Code is an open-source IDE to develop different types of applications on Windows, Mac, and Linux platform. 
   You can develop Python 3 applications by installing Python extension for VS Code from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

3.Online Python Shell

 Installing Python (or any software) can be a little daunting for a newbie. Fortunately there are many online resources 
 to get familiar with the syntax, features and philosophy of Python before deciding to install Python in the local machine.
  You can launch an online Python Shell directly from the official website - https://www.python.org/shell.
  
4.Pycharm
 Available as a cross-platform application, PyCharm is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. Sitting gracefully among the best Python IDEs, PyCharm provides support for both Python 2 (2.7) and Python 3 (3.5 and above) versions.
  PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language.
  It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ).
  
**Automatic Garbage collection
Python: Automatic Garbage collection Garbage collection in Python works automatically. When no reference is left to a 
variable/data/value or object then the memory occupied by that object is freed up by garbage collection mechanism of python. 
Thus, python provides with good memory management and prevents the wastage of memory.
